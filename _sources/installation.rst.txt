Installation
============
.. note::
    :code:`pymer4` since version 0.6.0 is only compatible with Python 3. Versions 0.5.0 and lower will work with Python 2, but will not contain any new features.

Using Anaconda (recommended)
----------------------------

For the latest stable release (recommended)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

:code:`pymer4` has some dependecies that can only be resolved using `conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org/>`_ (e.g. recent version of :code:`rpy2`). For this reason you may want to install it into a separate conda environment to avoid conflicts with any existing packages you have installed:

    .. code-block:: bash

        conda create --name pymer4 -c ejolly -c defaults -c conda-forge pymer4
        conda activate pymer4 

Otherwise you can install into an existing environment with:

    .. code-block:: bash

        conda install -c ejolly -c defaults -c conda-forge pymer4

.. note::
    Both commands above try to resolve dependencies without using conda-forge, unless absolutely necessary (i.e. lowest priority). This is why it's the last channel specified in the command.
    
If you are already using pacakges from conda-forge in your environment and prefer to use it for all dependecies simply omit the :code:`defaults` channel:

    .. code-block:: bash

        conda install -c ejolly -c conda-forge pymer4

For the latest development release
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Simply use either command above and substitute :code:`ejolly` for :code:`ejolly/label/pre-release`, i.e.

    .. code-block:: bash

        conda install -c ejolly/label/pre-release -c defaults -c conda-forge pymer4

For previous stable or development releases
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Simple use either command above and specify the version e.g.

    .. code-block:: bash

        conda install -c ejolly -c defaults -c conda-forge pymer4=0.7.2

Or

    .. code-block:: bash

        conda install -c ejolly/label/pre-release -c defaults -c conda-forge pymer4=0.7.3.dev2


Using pip
---------

.. warning::
    It's strongly advised to use the conda install method above because of how notoriously finicky it can be to install :code:`rpy2` on various platforms. I recommend only following the directions below if you're comfortable with :code:`pip` and the command line or prefer not to use Anaconda.

Prerequisites
+++++++++++++
:code:`pymer4` requires a working R installation along with three R packages: :code:`lme4`, :code:`lmerTest`, and :code:`emmeans`. Follow either option below to make sure these are installed.

1. If you already have R/RStudio installed
##########################################
Make sure you also have the 3 required R packages which can be installed from within R/RStudio using: 

    .. code-block:: R

        install.packages(c('lme4','lmerTest','emmeans'))

2. If you don't have R/RStudio installed
########################################
The `Anaconda Python distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_ can also install and maintain R and R-packages for you. To install R and the the required packages through Anaconda:

 .. code-block:: bash

        conda install -c conda-forge r r-base r-lmertest r-emmeans rpy2

For the latest stable release
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
After either option you can pip install :code:`pymer4`

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip install pymer4

For the latest development release
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Install via github:

    .. code-block:: bash

        pip install git+https://github.com/ejolly/pymer4.git


Making sure the install worked
------------------------------
You can test the installation by running the following command in a terminal

    .. code-block:: bash

        python -c "from pymer4.test_install import test_install; test_install()"

Installation Issues
-------------------

If you have installed via :code:`pip` it's recommended you try the :code:`conda` method described above prior to raising an issue on github. Otherwise the following solutions may help. 

Missing R packages
++++++++++++++++++

If you follow step 2 in the prerequisites above (i.e. let Anaconda install R for you), some users have reported that the ``conda install`` command above sometimes doesn't install everything you need; for example the `matrix <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Matrix/index.html>`_ package. You can fix this by either installing any missing packages from within R directly by first launching R at a terminal using ``R``, then adding the package with ``install.packages("Matrix")`` or by using Anaconda and prepending ``r-`` infront of the *lowercase* name of the package: ``conda install -c conda-forge r-matrix``. 


Compiler Issues on macOS
++++++++++++++++++++++++
Some of the more cryptic error messages you might encounter on macOS are due to compiler issues that give ``rpy2`` (a package dependency of ``pymer4``) some issues during install. Here's a fix that should work for that:

1. Install `homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_ if you don't have it already by running the command at the link (it's a great pacakage manager for macOS). To check if you already have it, do ``which brew`` in your Terminal. If nothing pops up you don't have it.
2. Fix brew permissions: ``sudo chown -R $(whoami) $(brew --prefix)/*`` (this is **necessary** on macOS Sierra or higher (>= macOS 10.12))
3. Update homebrew ``brew update``
4. Install the xz uitility ``brew install xz``
5. At this point you can try to re-install ``pymer4`` and re-test the installation. If it still doesn't work follow the next few steps below
6. Install an updated compiler: ``brew install gcc``, or if you have homebrew already, ``brew upgrade gcc``
7. Enable the new compiler for use:

    .. code-block:: bash

        export CC="$(find `brew info gcc | grep usr | sed 's/(.*//' | awk '{printf $1"/bin"}'` -name 'x86*gcc-?')"
        export CFLAGS="-W"

8. If the above results in any error output (it should return nothing) you might need to manually find out where the new compiler is installed. To do so use ``brew info gcc`` and ``cd`` into the directory that begins with ``/usr`` in the output of that command. From there ``cd`` into ``bin`` and look for a file that begins with ``x86`` and ends with ``gcc-7``. It's possible that the directory ends with ``gcc-8`` or a higher number based on how recently you installed from homebrew. In that case, just use the latest version. Copy the *full path* to that file and run the following:

    .. code-block:: bash

        export CC= pathYouCopiedInQuotes
        export CFLAGS="-W"

9. Finally install ``rpy2`` using the new compiler you just installed: ``pip install rpy2`` if you have R/RStudio or ``conda install -c conda-forge rpy2`` if you don't.
10. Now you should be able to ``pip install pymer4`` :)

Kernel Crashes in Jupyter Notebooks/Lab
---------------------------------------
Sometimes using ``pymer4`` interactively can cause the Python kernel to crash. This is more likely to happen if you have multiple interactive sessions running simulatenously. One way around this is to put this at the top of your notebook/code:

    .. code-block:: python

        import os
        os.environ['KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK']='True'

Or set the following environment variable prior to launching your interactive sessions:

    .. code-block:: bash

        export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE
